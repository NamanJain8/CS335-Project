offset need to be updated in VarSpec

offset also need to be added in symbol table, while adding an ident, top offset need to be incremented by size of ident

if new scope (new block), push offset = 0, to offset stack

need to make scope in case of: for, if, else, function (done), 

Can add non terminal for append, to make slice working

add try execpt blocks (better way is to add data in list despite error)
